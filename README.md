- Modifying and maintenance of testing equipment.
- Running & assisting in lab reasearch experiments.
- Creation of R&D testing rigs

# What I bring to a team?
- I bring a variety of both technical and general skills that can be applicable to an engineering project. With this I have found myself in projects under many different roles, either doing CAD work, software development, electrical systems, making presentations, and more.
- For my role in a team I typically tend to gravitate towards a technical role and am happy to work under leadership. Although, I have also demonstrated initiative to take charge of general project goals and tasks as well.

# Future Career
 After my previous two internships (Infinite and Quanser). I have determined that I enjoy working at smaller companies with fewer employees and a tight nit community.
 At both of these companies I was given a lot of independence and freedom to complete task on my own, and in my own way.
 Additionally, these companies taught me about every aspect of themselves by having me move around and fuffill different roles.
 One week I could be writing a report or researching, the next manufacturing parts in a shop, and the next coding a custom robotic for testing.
 This combined with the tight nit teams that would not hesistate to help out or teach me new things, made these experiences very enjoyable, 
 and as such, provides me motiviation to look and work for a company with a similar work experience.
